            <p class="leading-relaxed text-base"> I'm a coder, learner and enthusiast writer who sometimes likes to paint and play musical instruments as well.
                I'm an incoming Master's student at the University of Windsor where I'll be majoring in computer science and minoring in business. I obtained my
                Bachelor's degree in Information and Technology from Bharati Vidyapeeth's College of Engineering, New Delhi.
                Previously, I was working as a Business Analyst Intern at Ola
                Electric. Domains like Computer Vision, Data Science and game development excite me. </p>
